DESCRIPTION

- In this lab, a program is made whose functionality is to take a graph as an input and find the shortest path from given vertices using Breath First Search (BFS) algorithm.
- Graph ADT is used to implement and solve this problem.
- Command line arguments:  -i <name> (specifies the input file)
			   -o <name> (specifies the output file).

FILES

1. List.h 
- This header file is an interface to the List ADT as it declares the methods it provides.

2. List.c
- This source file implements and declares the methods and the List ADT itself.

3. Graph.h 
- This header file is an interface to the Graph ADT as it declares the methods it provides.

4. List.c
- This source file implements and declares the methods and the Graph ADT itself. It also implements the BFS algrotihm.

5. GraphTest.c
- This source file is used to test the functions of the Graph ADT.

6. Makefile
