DESCRIPTION

- In this lab, a sparse matrix is implemented in order to save memory on representing matrices and performing operations on a sparse matrix.
- List ADT is used to implement and solve this problem.
- Command line arguments:  <name> (specifies the input file)
			   <name> (specifies the output file).

4. Matrix.c
- This source file implements and declares the methods and the Matrix ADT itself. 

5. MatrixTest.c
- This source file is used to test the functions of the Matrix ADT.

6. ListTest.c
- This source file is used to test the functions of the List ADT.

7. Sparse.c
- This source file contains main function and handles IO as well as performing certain operations on a sparse Matrix.
